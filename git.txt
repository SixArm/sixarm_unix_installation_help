== Git

Install Git, e.g. version 1.6.1

Git table completion

  echo "source ~root/sources/git-1.6.1/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash" >> /etc/bash.bashrc

Tell git-branch and git-checkout to setup new branches so that git-pull(1)
will appropriately merge from that remote branch.  Recommended.  Without this,
you will have to add --track to your branch command or manually merge remote
tracking branches with "fetch" and then "merge".

  git config --global branch.autosetupmerge true
